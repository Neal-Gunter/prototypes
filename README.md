# 硬件验证 · 概念演示

Clickable concept mock for a browser place where a maker walks a hardware idea through idea, simulation, and assembly. The interface copy is Simplified Chinese. Every page shows the banner `Concept mock, not a working product`.

This is not a working product. Nothing here loads MuJoCo, simulates an ESP32-S3, stores a waitlist, or gives real soldering instructions.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Pages

- `/` — pitch, flow (想法 → 仿真 → 装配), three feature cards, who-it's-for strip, waitlist form
- `/example` — eight-tentacle robot driven by an ESP32-S3, with tabs 想法 / 仿真 / 装配 (`?tab=idea|simulate|assemble`)

## What is stubbed

- MuJoCo WASM mechanical / physics panel: placeholder, library not loaded
- ESP32-S3 firmware / MCU panel: placeholder, chip not simulated
- Servo slider: animates a tentacle drawing only; it does not drive either panel
- Soldering checklist: sample lines for the mock; ticks stay in page state
- Waitlist: email plus an optional free-text answer, held in page state only; nothing is sent or stored
